Introduction

We've learned how to write queries to retrieve information from the database. Now, we are going to learn how to perform calculations using SQL.

Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

In this lesson, we have given you a table named fake_apps which is made up of fake mobile applications data.

Here is a quick preview of some important aggregates that we will cover in the next five exercises:

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Let's get started!



// Count

The fastest way to calculate how many rows are in a table is to use the COUNT() function.

COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and counts the number of non-empty values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

Here, we want to count every row, so we pass * as an argument inside the parenthesis.

example

1.
Let's count how many apps are in the table.

In the code editor, run:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps;


2.// menghitung nilai yang kosong
Add a WHERE clause in the previous query to count how many free apps are in the table.

Remember the WHERE statement?

The following code should go inside the previous query, before the semicolon:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price = 0;



// SUM

SQL makes it easy to add all values in a particular column using SUM().

SUM() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

What is the total number of downloads for all of the apps combined?

SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;
This adds all values in the downloads column.





// MAX OR MIN

The MAX() and MIN() functions return the highest and lowest values in a column, respectively.

How many downloads does the most popular app have?

SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

The most popular app has 31,090 downloads!

MAX() takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the largest value in that column. Here, we returned the largest value in the downloads column.

MIN() works the same way but it does the exact opposite; it returns the smallest value.




// AVERAGE

SQL uses the AVG() function to quickly calculate the average value of a particular column.

The statement below returns the average number of downloads for an app in our database:

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

The AVG() function works by taking a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.




// ROUND

By default, SQL tries to be as precise as possible without rounding. We can make the result table easier to read using the ROUND() function.

ROUND() function takes two arguments inside the parenthesis:

a column name
an integer
It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer.

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

Here, we pass the column price and integer 0 as arguments. SQL rounds the values in the column to 0 decimal places in the output.

example

1.
Let's return the name column and a rounded price column.

In the code editor, type:

SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

2.
Remove the previous query.

In the last exercise, we were able to get the average price of an app ($2.02365) using this query:

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;

Now, let's edit this query so that it rounds this result to 2 decimal places.

This is a tricky one!

You can treat AVG(price) just like any other value and place it inside the ROUND function like so:

ROUND(AVG(price), 2) // untuk 2 kasus yang berbeda

Here, AVG(price) is the 1st argument and 2 is the 2nd argument because we want to round it to two decimal places:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;



// GROUP BY I

Oftentimes, we will want to calculate an aggregate for data with certain characteristics.

For instance, we might want to know the mean IMDb ratings for all movies each year. We could calculate each number by a series of queries with different WHERE statements, like so:

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 1999;

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2000;

SELECT AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
WHERE year = 2001;

and so on.

Luckily, there's a better way!

We can use GROUP BY to do this in a single step:

SELECT year,
   AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.

The GROUP BY statement comes after any WHERE statements, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT.

example

In the code editor, type:

SELECT price, COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;
Here, our aggregate function is COUNT() and we arranged price into groups.

What do you expect the result to be?



2.
In the previous query, add a WHERE clause to count the total number of apps that have been downloaded more than 20,000 times, at each price.

Remember, WHERE statement goes before the GROUP BY statement:

SELECT price, COUNT(*) 
FROM fake_apps
WHERE downloads > 20000
GROUP BY price;

3.
Remove the previous query.

Write a new query that calculates the total number of downloads for each category.

Select category and SUM(downloads).

First, select the two columns we want:

SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

Next, group the result for each category by adding a GROUP BY:

SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;





// Group By II

Sometimes, we want to GROUP BY a calculation done on a column.

For instance, we might want to know how many movies have IMDb ratings that round to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. We could do this using the following syntax:

SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY ROUND(imdb_rating)
ORDER BY ROUND(imdb_rating);

However, this query may be time-consuming to write and more prone to error.

SQL lets us use column reference(s) in our GROUP BY that will make our lives easier.

1 is the first column selected
2 is the second column selected
3 is the third column selected

and so on.

The following query is equivalent to the one above:

SELECT ROUND(imdb_rating),
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

Here, the 1 refers to the first column in our SELECT statement, ROUND(imdb_rating).

example

1.
Suppose we have the query below:

SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category, price;
Write the exact query, but use column reference numbers instead of column names after GROUP BY.

These numbers represent the selected columns:

1 refers to category.
2 refers to price.
3 refers to AVG(downloads)
Now, change the GROUP BY with numbers:

SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY 1, 2;

Note: Even if you use column names instead of numbers, it will still be correct because these two queries are exactly the same!




// Having

In addition to being able to group data using GROUP BY, SQL also allows you to filter which groups to include and which to exclude.

For instance, imagine that we want to see how many movies of different genres were produced each year, but we only care about years and genres with at least 10 movies.

We can't use WHERE here because we don't want to filter the rows; we want to filter groups.

This is where HAVING comes in.

HAVING is very similar to WHERE. In fact, all types of WHERE clauses you learned about thus far can be used with HAVING.

We can use the following for the problem:

SELECT year,
   genre,
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;

When we want to limit the results of a query based on values of the individual rows, use WHERE.
When we want to limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property, use HAVING.
HAVING statement always comes after GROUP BY, but before ORDER BY and LIMIT.

example

Suppose we have the query below:

SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;

It returns the average downloads (rounded) and the number of apps â€“ at each price point.

However, certain price points don't have very many apps, so their average downloads are less meaningful.

Add a HAVING clause to restrict the query to price points that have more than 10 apps.

The total number of apps at each price point would be given by COUNT(*).

SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

COUNT(*) > 10 is the condition.

Because the condition has an aggregate function in it, we have to use HAVING instead of WHERE.


// IMPORTANT 

Review
Congratulations!

You just learned how to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on your data. What can we generalize so far?

COUNT(): count the number of rows
SUM(): the sum of the values in a column
MAX()/MIN(): the largest/smallest value
AVG(): the average of the values in a column
ROUND(): round the values in the column
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.

GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
HAVING limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.
