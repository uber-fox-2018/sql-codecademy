Introduction

In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

For instance, imagine that we're running a magazine company where users can have different types of subscriptions to different products. Different subscriptions might have many different properties. Each customer would also have lots of associated information.

We could have one table with all of the following information:

order_id
customer_id
customer_name
customer_address
subscription_id
subscription_description
subscription_monthly_price
subscription_length
purchase_date
However, a lot of this information would be repeated. If the same customer has multiple subscriptions, that customer's name and address will be reported multiple times. If the same subscription type is ordered by multiple customers, then the subscription price and subscription description will be repeated. This will make our table big and unmanageable.

So instead, we can split our data into three tables:

orders would contain just the information necessary to describe what was ordered:
order_id
customer_id
subscription_id
purchase_date
subscriptions would contain the information to describe each type of subscription:
subscription_id
description
price_per_month
subscription_length
customers would contain the information for each customer:
customer_id
customer_name
address
In this lesson, we'll learn the SQL commands that will help us work with data that is stored in multiple tables.

// example

Examine these tables by pasting the following code into the editor:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;

SELECT * 
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;




// Combining Tables Manually

Let's return to our magazine company. Suppose we have the three tables described in the previous exercise – shown in the browser on the right (we are going to try something new!):

orders
subscriptions
customers
If we just look at the orders table, we can't really tell what's happened in each order. However, if we refer to the other tables, we can get a complete picture.

Let's examine the order with an order_id of 2. It was purchased by the customer with a customer_id of 2.

To find out the customer's name, we look at the customers table and look for the item with a customer_id value of 2. We can see that Customer 2's name is 'Jane Doe' and that she lives at '456 Park Ave'.

Doing this kind of matching is called joining two tables.



// Combining Tables with SQL

Combining tables manually is time-consuming. Luckily, SQL gives us an easy sequence for this: it's called a JOIN.

If we want to combine orders and customers, we would type:

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
Let's break down this command:

The first line selects all columns from our combined table. If we only want to select certain columns, we can specify which ones we want.
The second line specifies the first table that we want to look in, orders
The third line uses JOIN to say that we want to combine information from orders with customers.
The fourth line tells us how to combine the two tables. We want to match orders table's customer_id column with customers table's customer_id column.
Because column names are often repeated across multiple tables, we use the syntax table_name.column_name to be sure that our requests for columns are unambiguous. In our example, we use this syntax in the ON statement, but we will also use it in the SELECT or any other statement where we refer to column names.

For example: Instead of selecting all the columns using *, if we only wanted to select orders table's order_id column and customers table's customer_name column, we could use the following query:

SELECT orders.order_id,
   customers.customer_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

// example

Join orders table and subscriptions table and select all columns.

Make sure to join on the subscription_id column.

Suppose we do:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 10;
You will notice that both orders table and subscriptions table have a subscription_id column.

And we want to match these two columns:

orders.subscription_id  // answere
subscriptions.subscription_id
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

Notice that in the column subscriptions.subscription_id, the table name has a 's' in the end.

// example

Suppose we do:

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 10;
You will notice that both orders table and subscriptions table have a subscription_id column.

And we want to match these two columns:

orders.subscription_id
subscriptions.subscription_id
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;
Notice that in the column subscriptions.subscription_id, the table name has a 's' in the end.

2.
Don't remove the previous query.

Add a second query after your first one that only selects rows from the join where description is equal to 'Fashion Magazine'.

The WHERE clause goes after the JOIN!

Answer:

-- Checkpoint 1

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

-- Checkpoint 2

SELECT *                // answere
FROM orders
JOIN subscriptions
  ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';

What is the difference between the two result tables?



// Inner Joins // menggabungkan 2 tabel yang sama,
yang tidak sama dihilangkan

Let's revisit how we joined orders and customers. For every possible value of customer_id in orders, there was a corresponding row of customers with the same customer_id.

What if that wasn't true?

For instance, imagine that our customers table was out of date, and was missing any information on customer 11. If that customer had an order in orders, what would happen when we joined the tables?

When we perform a simple JOIN (often called an inner join) our result only includes rows that match our ON condition.

Consider the following animation, which illustrates an inner join of two tables on table1.c2 = table2.c2: Animation of an Inner Join The first and last rows have matching values of c2. The middle rows do not match. The final result has all values from the first and last rows but does not include the non-matching middle row.

//example

.
Suppose we are working for The Codecademy Times, a newspaper with two types of subscriptions:

print newspaper
online articles
Some users subscribe to just the newspaper, some subscribe to just the online edition, and some subscribe to both.

There is a newspaper table that contains information about the newspaper subscribers.

Count the number of subscribers who get a print newspaper using COUNT().

Use COUNT(*) to count all rows of a table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper;
2.
Don't remove your previous query.

There is also an online table that contains information about the online subscribers.

Count the number of subscribers who get an online newspaper using COUNT().


3.
Don't remove your previous queries.

Join newspaper table and online table on their id columns (the unique ID of the subscriber).

How many rows are in this table?

Suppose we do:

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM online
LIMIT 10;
You will notice that both newspaper table and online table have an id column.

And we want to match these two columns:

newspaper.id
online.id
Your ON statement should look like this:

ON newspaper.id = online.id
Remember to use SELECT COUNT(*) to count the rows:

SELECT COUNT(*)  // answare
FROM newspaper
JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id;




// Left Joins

What if we want to combine two tables and keep some of the un-matched rows?

SQL lets us do this through a command called LEFT JOIN. A left join will keep all rows from the first table, regardless of whether there is a matching row in the second table.

Consider the following animation: Animation of a Left Join The first and last rows have matching values of c2. The middle rows do not match. The final result will keep all rows of the first table but will omit the un-matched row from the second table.

This animation represents a table operation produced by the following command:

SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.c2 = table2.c2;
The first line selects all columns from both tables.
The second line selects table1 (the "left" table).
The third line performs a LEFT JOIN on table2 (the "right" table).
The fourth line tells SQL how to perform the join (by looking for matching values in column c2.

// example

1.
Let's return to our newspaper and online subscribers.

Suppose we want to know how many users subscribe to the print newspaper, but not to the online.

Start by performing a left join of newspaper table and online table on their id columns and selecting all columns.

Remember to put newspaper first to keep all rows of newspaper:

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id;
2.
Don't remove your previous query.

In order to find which users do not subscribe to the online edition, we need to add a WHERE clause.

Add a second query after your first one that adds the following WHERE clause and condition:

WHERE online.id IS NULL
This will select rows where there was no corresponding row from the online table.

Don't remove your previous query.

Add the second query so you can compare the results!

The second query should look like:

SELECT *                   // answare
FROM newspaper
LEFT JOIN online
  ON newspaper.id = online.id
WHERE online.id IS NULL;

Remember, WHERE clause goes after the LEFT JOIN.




// Primary Key vs Foreign Key

Let's return to our example of the magazine subscriptions. Recall that we had three tables: orders, subscriptions, and customers.

Each of these tables has a column that uniquely identifies each row of that table:

order_id for orders
subscription_id for subscriptions
customer_id for customers
These special columns are called primary keys.

Primary keys have a few requirements:

None of the values can be NULL.
Each value must be unique (i.e., you can't have two customers with the same customer_id in the customers table).
A table can not have more than one primary key column.
Let's reexamine the orders table:

order_id	customer_id	subscription_id	purchase_date
1	2	3	2017-01-01
2	2	2	2017-01-01
3	3	1	2017-01-01

Note that customer_id (the primary key for customers) and subscription_id (the primary key for subscriptions) both appear in this.

When the primary key for one table appears in a different table, it is called a foreign key.

So customer_id is a primary key when it appears in customers, but a foreign key when it appears in orders.

In this example, our primary keys all had somewhat descriptive names. Generally, the primary key will just be called id. Foreign keys will have more descriptive names.

Why is this important? The most common types of joins will be joining a foreign key from one table with the primary key from another table. For instance, when we join orders and customers, we join on customer_id, which is a foreign key in orders and the primary key in customers.

// example

1.
Suppose Columbia University has two tables in their database:

The classes table contains information on the classes that the school offers. Its primary key is id.
The students table contains information on all students in the school. Its primary key is id. It contains the foreign key class_id, which corresponds to the primary key of classes.
Perform an inner join of classes and students using the primary and foreign keys described above, and select all the columns.

Your ON statement should include:

classes.id (a primary key)
students.class_id (a foreign key)
It should look like:

SELECT *
FROM classes
JOIN students
  ON classes.id = students.class_id;

You should already know how to do this join. But in this exercise, you learned that the matching column is usually a primary key of a table and foreign key of another!




// Cross Join

So far, we've focused on matching rows that have some information in common.

Sometimes, we just want to combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

For instance, if we had a table of shirts and a table of pants, we might want to know all the possible combinations to create different outfits.

Our code might look like this:

SELECT shirts.shirt_color,
   pants.pants_color
FROM shirts
CROSS JOIN pants;
The first two lines select the columns shirt_color and pants_color.
The third line pulls data from the table shirts.
The fourth line performs a CROSS JOIN with pants.
Notice that cross joins don't require an ON statement. You're not really joining on any columns!

If we have 3 different shirts (white, grey, and olive) and 2 different pants (light denim and black), the results might look like this:

shirt_color	pants_color
white	light denim
white	black
grey	light denim
grey	black
olive	light denim
olive	black
3 shirts × 2 pants = 6 combinations!

This clothing example is fun, but it's not very practically useful.

A more common usage of CROSS JOIN is when we need to compare each row of a table to a list of values.

Let's return to our newspaper subscriptions. This table contains two columns that we haven't discussed yet:

start_month: the first month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper (i.e., 2 for February)
end_month: the final month where the customer subscribed to the print newspaper
Suppose we wanted to know how many users were subscribed during each month of the year. For each month (1, 2, 3) we would need to know if a user was subscribed. Follow the steps below to see how we can use a CROSS JOIN to solve this problem.

// example

1.
Eventually, we'll use a cross join to help us, but first, let's try a simpler problem.

Let's start by counting the number of customers who were subscribed to the newspaper during March.

Use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows and a WHERE clause to restrict to two conditions:

start_month <= 3
end_month >= 3
"During March" means that the customer's starting month was in or before March and final month was in or after March:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
WHERE start_month <= 3 
  AND end_month >= 3;
Answer: 13

2.
Don't remove the previous query.

The previous query lets us investigate one month at a time. In order to check across all months, we're going to need to use a cross join.

Our database contains another table called months which contains the numbers between 1 and 12.

Select all columns from the cross join of newspaper and months.

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months;
When you get the result, make sure to scroll right to take a look at the rightmost column, month.

Each customer is CROSS JOIN'ed with each month.

3.
Don't remove your previous queries.

Create a third query where you add a WHERE statement to your cross join to restrict to two conditions:

start_month <= month
end_month >= month
This will select all months where a user was subscribed.

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE ________ AND ________;
Scroll down to take a look at the result of this query.

Notice how it filtered from the previous CROSS JOIN.

Scroll right to look at the month column – some months are gone now.

4.
Don't remove your previous queries.

Create a final query where you aggregate over each month to count the number of subscribers.

Fill in the blanks in the following query:

SELECT month,
  COUNT(*)
FROM ________
CROSS JOIN ________
WHERE ________ AND ________
GROUP BY ________;


// answare

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
WHERE start_month <= 3 
  AND end_month >= 3;
  
SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months;

SELECT *
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month 
  AND end_month >= month;

SELECT month, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM newspaper
CROSS JOIN months
WHERE start_month <= month 
  AND end_month >= month
GROUP BY month;




// Union

Sometimes we just want to stack one dataset on top of the other. Well, the UNION operator allows us to do that.

Suppose we have two tables and they have the same columns.

table1:

pokemon	type
Bulbasaur	Grass
Charmander	Fire
Squirtle	Water
table2:

pokemon	type
Snorlax	Normal
If we combine these two with UNION:

SELECT *
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT *
FROM table2;

The result would be:

pokemon	type
Bulbasaur	Grass
Charmander	Fire
Squirtle	Water
Snorlax	Normal
SQL has strict rules for appending data:

Tables must have the same number of columns.
The columns must have the same data types in the same order as the first table.
Instructions
1.
Let's return to our newspaper and online subscriptions. We'd like to create one big table with both sets of data.

Use UNION to stack the newspaper table on top of the online table.

// example

Use UNION to stack the newspaper table on top of the online table.

SELECT * 
FROM newspaper 
UNION 
SELECT * 
FROM online;





// With

Often times, we want to combine two tables, but one of the tables is the result of another calculation.

Let's return to our magazine order example. Our marketing department might want to know a bit more about our customers. For instance, they might want to know how many magazines each customer subscribes to. We can easily calculate this using our orders table:

SELECT customer_id,
   COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
This query is good, but a customer_id isn't terribly useful for our marketing department, they probably want to know the customer's name.

We want to be able to join the results of this query with our customers table, which will tell us the name of each customer. We can do this by using a WITH clause.

WITH previous_results AS (
   SELECT ...
   ...
   ...
   ...
)
SELECT *
FROM previous_results
JOIN customers
  ON _____ = _____;
The WITH statement allows us to perform a separate query (such as aggregating customer's subscriptions)
previous_results is the alias that we will use to reference any columns from the query inside of the WITH clause
We can then go on to do whatever we want with this temporary table (such as join the temporary table with another table)
Essentially, we are putting a whole first query inside the parentheses () and giving it a name. After that, we can use this name as if it's a table and write a new query using the first query.

// example

1.
Place the whole query below into a WITH statement, inside parentheses (), and give it name previous_query:

SELECT customer_id,
   COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
Join the temporary table previous_query with customers table and select the following columns:

customers.customer_name
previous_query.subscriptions
Check the answer in the hint below.

Remember to use the following ON statement as part of your JOIN:

ON previous_query.customer_id = customers.customer_id
And for review, AS is how you give something an alias.

Here, we are essentially giving everything inside the parentheses (the sub-query) the name of previous_query using AS.

Then, previous_query is used as a temporary table that we will query from and also join with the customers table:

WITH previous_query AS (  // answare
   SELECT customer_id,
      COUNT(subscription_id) AS 'subscriptions'
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customers.customer_name, 
   previous_query.subscriptions
FROM previous_query
JOIN customers
  ON previous_query.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

Do not include ; inside of the () of your WITH statement.




// Review

In this lesson, we learned about relationships between tables in relational databases and how to query information from multiple tables using SQL.

Let's summarize what we've learned so far:

JOIN will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.

LEFT JOIN will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.

Primary key is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.

Foreign key is a column that contains the primary key to another table.

CROSS JOIN lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

UNION stacks one dataset on top of another.

WITH allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.
